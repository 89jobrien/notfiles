# notfiles

A pure-Rust dotfiles manager — and eventually, a complete new-machine bootstrap system.

`notfiles` started as a Rust replacement for [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). It's growing into a **Cargo workspace** of focused crates that together replace an entire shell-script-based dotfiles ecosystem.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Symlink your dotfiles
notfiles link

# Check status
notfiles status

# Remove symlinks
notfiles unlink
```

On a new machine (once `notstrap` ships):

```bash
cargo install notstrap
notstrap run
```

## Workspace Architecture

```
notfiles/
├── crates/
│   ├── notcore/        # shared types, config, paths, errors
│   ├── notfiles/       # symlink engine (stow replacement)  ← you are here
│   ├── notsecrets/     # age key retrieval + sops decrypt
│   ├── nothooks/       # hook execution engine
│   └── notstrap/       # new-machine bootstrap orchestrator
├── notfiles.toml       # symlink package config
└── notstrap.toml       # bootstrap hook/phase config
```

### Crate responsibilities

| Crate | Type | Does |
|-------|------|------|
| `notcore` | lib | Shared types, config, paths, errors — no deps on other crates |
| `notfiles` | lib + bin | Symlink/copy packages into `$HOME`, track state |
| `notsecrets` | lib | Retrieve age key → sops decrypt → inject secrets |
| `nothooks` | lib + bin | Run bootstrap hooks in phases, skip already-run setup hooks |
| `notstrap` | bin | Orchestrate everything on a fresh machine |

### Dependency graph

```
notstrap
  ├── notfiles
  │     └── notcore
  ├── notsecrets
  │     └── notcore
  └── nothooks
        └── notcore
```

`notcore` is the only shared dependency. No circular deps.

## How `notfiles` Works

Each subdirectory of your dotfiles repo is a **package**. `notfiles link` walks each package and symlinks its contents into a target directory (default: `$HOME`), mirroring the directory structure.

```
dotfiles/
└── zsh/
    └── .zshrc          →  symlink  →  ~/.zshrc

dotfiles/
└── git/
    └── .config/
        └── git/
            └── config  →  symlink  →  ~/.config/git/config
```

State is tracked in `.notfiles-state.toml` so `unlink` and `status` know exactly what was linked, when, and how.

### Link flow

```
notfiles link
  │
  ├─ resolve_packages()     discover subdirs or validate requested names
  │
  ├─ collect_files()        recursive walk, apply ignore patterns (globset)
  │
  ├─ conflict_check()       existing file? symlink to wrong target?
  │
  └─ linker::link_package() create symlinks (or copies), write state
```

### State file

`.notfiles-state.toml` records every linked file:

```toml
[[entries]]
source = "/Users/joe/dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc"
target = "/Users/joe/.zshrc"
method = "symlink"
package = "zsh"
linked_at = "2026-03-31T10:00:00Z"
```

This powers `status` (diff expected vs actual) and `unlink` (clean removal with empty-parent cleanup).

---

## New Machine Bootstrap (notstrap)

The hardest part of a new machine is the chicken-and-egg problem: you need secrets to set up the machine, but secrets live in an encrypted file that requires a key you haven't retrieved yet.

`notstrap` solves this with a staged bootstrap:

```
notstrap run
  │
  ├─ 1. Prerequisites check
  │      Is bw/sops/age available? Print exactly what's missing and stop.
  │
  ├─ 2. notsecrets — retrieve age key
  │      ├─ try: Bitwarden CLI (bw unlock)
  │      ├─ fallback: --key-file <path>  (USB drive)
  │      └─ fallback: interactive prompt (paste key)
  │          └─ sops decrypt secrets.sops.env → env injected
  │             (now op, bw, github, openai, anthropic tokens are live)
  │
  ├─ 3. Clone dotfiles repo (if not present)
  │
  ├─ 4. notfiles link — stow all packages
  │
  ├─ 5. nothooks --phase dot
  │      shell config, git config, AI tool configs (~seconds, re-runnable)
  │
  ├─ 6. nothooks --phase setup
  │      Homebrew/Nix packages, mise runtimes, dev tools, op install (~minutes, once)
  │
  └─ 7. Report
         ✓ linked 142 files  ✓ 3 dot hooks  ✓ 7 setup hooks
```

Note: 1Password (`op`) is installed as a **hook** in phase `setup` — after secrets are already available via sops. It takes over secret management for day-to-day use once the machine is live.

---

## Secrets Bootstrap Detail

`notsecrets` implements an `AgeKeySource` trait with three sources tried in order:

```
AgeKeySource
  ├── BitwardenSource   bw unlock → session token → bw get item age-key
  ├── FileSource        read from --key-file path (USB, etc.)
  └── PromptSource      read from stdin (paste)
```

Once the age key is retrieved, it's written to `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt` and `sops` decrypts `secrets.sops.env`. The decrypted file contains all critical bootstrap credentials (op, bw, github, openai, anthropic, etc.) and is injected into the environment for subsequent hooks.

---

## Hook Phases

`nothooks` runs hooks in two phases defined in `notstrap.toml`:

| Phase | Speed | Re-runnable | Examples |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `dot` | ~seconds | Yes | shell config, git config, AI tool configs |
| `setup` | ~minutes | No (tracked) | Homebrew packages, mise runtimes, op install |

`setup` hooks are tracked in `.nothooks-state.toml` — already-run hooks are skipped unless `--force` is passed. `dot` hooks always re-run (they're idempotent by design).

---

## Configuration

### `notfiles.toml` — symlink config

```toml
[defaults]
method = "symlink"
target = "~"

[packages.secrets]
method = "copy"    # copy instead of symlink for sensitive files

[packages.work]
target = "~/work"  # different target dir
ignore = ["*.local"]
```

### `notstrap.toml` — bootstrap config

```toml
[bootstrap]
dotfiles_repo = "git@github.com:you/dotfiles.git"
dotfiles_dir = "~/dotfiles"

[[hooks]]
name = "shell-config"
script = "scripts/setup-git-config.sh"
phase = "dot"

[[hooks]]
name = "homebrew-packages"
script = "scripts/setup-packages.sh"
phase = "setup"
```

---

## Migration from dotfiles/

Migration is gradual — shell scripts are replaced as Rust equivalents ship:

| Phase | Ships | Replaces |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | `notfiles` workspace (now) | GNU Stow |
| 2 | `notsecrets` + `notstrap` skeleton | `setup-secrets.sh`, `install.sh` |
| 3 | `nothooks` | `bootstrap.sh` hook runner |
| 4 | Hook-by-hook Rust rewrites | Individual `setup-*.sh` scripts |
| 5 | `dotfiles/` archived | — |
